# Universal Equality Blockchain

**A basis for free and equal economy, encapsulated in blockchain and smart contract technology**

## üîí Important Disclaimers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEMO MODE - SAFE FOR TESTING
- **Currently set to DEMO_MODE = true** - Safe to run and exit
- **No persistent storage** - All blockchain state exists only in memory
- **No files created** - Program leaves no traces on your system
- **Educational purpose** - Designed for learning and prototyping

### üö´ Production Warning
- **DO NOT use in production** without implementing proper ECDSA cryptography
- **Requires peer network** setup for real-world deployment
- **Simplified crypto** - Current implementation uses demo-grade security only

### üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT
- **ESSENTIAL SAFETY MECHANISM REQUIRED**: Any production implementation MUST enforce equal safety allocation "limits"
- **Treasury Protection**: Each user's withdrawal/transfer capacity MUST be safety capped to their proportional share of stable coins
- **Prevents Sabotage**: Without this constraint, a single malicious actor could deplete the entire treasury
- **INTEGRAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE**: Equal distribution requires equal risk limits - no user should access more funds than their peers without their consent
- **VITAL FOR SYSTEM INTEGRITY**: This is not optional - it's a foundational requirement for treasury security

## ÔøΩ Understanding the Code

**Easy way to learn:** Copy and paste the code into an AI LLM (GitHub Copilot Chat, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and ask it to explain what it does, how it works, and walk you through the implementation.

# aequchain readme

aequchain ‚Äî universal equidistributed blockchain (aequchain)

summary
- aequchain is a demonstration implementation of the universal equidistributed blockchain (ueb) concepts.
- it uses exact monetary precision via `rational{bigint}` and models global member coins, networks, businesses, pledges, and a tiny immutable block log for auditability.

quick start
- run the demo script (runs the built-in demo flow):

```bash
julia aequchain.jl
```

- or include and call functions from the julia REPL or a julia project:

```bash
julia --project -e 'include("aequchain.jl"); aequchain.run_demo()'
```

core functions (quick reference)
- `init_treasury(deposit::float64, currency::string, rate::float64, founder::string)` ‚Äî initialize treasury and create founder member.
- `join_member(id::string, deposit::float64)` ‚Äî add a new member by depositing exact value.
- `exit_member(id::string)` ‚Äî member exit and refund of equal-value share.
- `transfer(from::string, to::string, amount::float64)` ‚Äî logs a transfer (equality-preserving demo operation).
- `create_network(name::string, denom::string, rate::float64, creator::string)` ‚Äî create a network with a denomination.
- `join_network(member_id::string, net_id::string)` ‚Äî member joins a network.
- `create_business(name::string, owner::string, net_id::string)` ‚Äî create a business inside a network.
- `set_contrib_rate(bus_id::string, rate::float64, owner::string)` ‚Äî set business contribution rate (0 - 5%).
- `business_spend(bus_id::string, amount::float64, purpose::string, owner::string)` ‚Äî log business spending (checks allocation and 30-day limit).
- `create_pledge(name::string, target::float64, creator::string, net_id::string, purpose::string, is_business::bool, recurring::bool=false, monthly::float64=0.0)` ‚Äî create member or business pledge.
- `support_pledge(pledge_id::string, amount::float64, supporter::string)` ‚Äî support pledge (records spend, can mark completed).
- `print_status()` ‚Äî print a brief current state summary.
- `run_demo()` ‚Äî run the included demo flow.

data structures
- `treasury` ‚Äî global stablecoins, peg currency, peg rate.
- `membercoin` ‚Äî non-transferable membership coin (owner + minted_at).
- `network` ‚Äî networks with denom and denom_rate.
- `member` ‚Äî member metadata, networks, businesses, 30-day spend history and allowance.
- `business` ‚Äî business metadata, contrib rate, allocation budget and employees.
- `pledge` ‚Äî pledges with supporters, recurring flags and monthly amounts.
- `transaction` / `block` ‚Äî small immutable transaction and block structure used for audit logging in-memory.

notes & caveats
- demo mode: the included file runs in `demo_mode` and keeps all state in-memory; there is no persistent database.
- exact math: monetary values use `rational{bigint}` with cent precision to avoid floating-point rounding.
- recurring pledges: recurring behavior is simulated in the demo; production systems must schedule and persist recurring payouts.
- safety: members have a 30-day spend limit equal to their exact equal share; functions validate and record spends.
- this readme was added without modifying `aequchain.jl`.

## üîß Configuration

### Launch Parameters
Edit these constants in the Julia file:

```julia
const DEMO_MODE = true                    # Keep true for safe testing
const LAUNCH_PEG_AMOUNT = 1              # Your currency input amount
const LAUNCH_STABLE_COINS = 1.0          # Stable coins to create
const LAUNCH_PEG_CURRENCY = "USD"        # Peg currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
const LAUNCH_PEG_RATE = 1                # Exchange rate
```

### Example Configurations
```julia
# 100 ZAR creating ZAR-pegged coins:
LAUNCH_PEG_AMOUNT = 100.0, LAUNCH_STABLE_COINS = 100.0, 
LAUNCH_PEG_CURRENCY = "ZAR", LAUNCH_PEG_RATE = 1.0

# 17.27 ZAR creating USD-pegged coin:  
LAUNCH_PEG_AMOUNT = 17.27, LAUNCH_STABLE_COINS = 1.0,
LAUNCH_PEG_CURRENCY = "USD", LAUNCH_PEG_RATE = 17.27
```

## üåê Core Concepts

### Three Token Types

1. **Digital Asset** - Represents ownership of the entire system
2. **Stable Coins** - Pegged to real-world currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)
3. **Native Coins** - Equal-value membership tokens (treasury_value / members)

### Mathematical Equality
- All members hold native coins of exactly equal value
- Treasury value divided equally among all members
- Perfect economic equality maintained automatically

### Blockchain Architecture
- Every transaction creates a new block
- Every block validates the entire chain
- Immutable history with cryptographic linking
- Real-time consistency validation

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Memory Usage
- **Local testing**: < 1MB for small networks
- **Global scale**: < 800MB even with worldwide adoption
- **Embedded compatible**: Runs on IoT devices and mobile

### Network Architecture
- **1 node per member** - democratic participation
- **P2P networking** - no central servers required
- **Peer discovery** - automatic network formation
- **Broadcast validation** - consensus through validation

### Cryptography (DEMO MODE)
- **Key generation**: Simplified for demo safety
- **Transaction signing**: SHA-256 based (demo only)
- **Production ready**: Framework for ECDSA implementation

## üìã System Requirements

### Minimum
- **RAM**: 100MB available memory
- **CPU**: Any modern processor (ARM/x86/x64)
- **Storage**: No persistent storage required in demo mode
- **Network**: Optional (for P2P features)

### Recommended
- **RAM**: 1GB+ for large networks
- **CPU**: Multi-core for P2P networking
- **Network**: Stable internet for production deployment

## üîê Security Features

### DEMO Mode Safety
- No persistent files created
- Memory-only operation
- Safe to interrupt/exit at any time
- No system modifications

### Production Considerations
- Implement proper ECDSA key generation
- Add secure random number generation
- Deploy peer network infrastructure
- Add TLS/encryption for network communication

## ü§ù Contributing

This is an open-source educational project. Contributions welcome for:

- Production cryptography implementation
- Enhanced P2P networking
- Mobile/embedded optimizations
- Additional currency integrations

## üìÑ License

Open source - use at your own discretion and risk.

## üåü Vision

This blockchain represents a complete technical foundation for implementing true economic equality through mathematical guarantee rather than policy. Every member automatically receives exactly equal value, creating a basis for a free and equal economy powered by blockchain and smart contract technology.

**"A basis for free and equal economy, encapsulated in blockchain and smart contract technology"**
